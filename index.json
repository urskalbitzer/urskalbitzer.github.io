Environmental changes linked to human activities include climate change, landscape modifications, hunting and other interactions between human and non-human primates. Primates seem to be especially vulnerable to these rapid changes because of their slow life-histories and long generation times. On the other hand, primates show considerable behavioral flexibility, which may help them to respond to environmental change in an adaptive way (Kalbitzer \u0026amp; Chapman, 2018).\nThe question as to how such flexibility may help animals to respond to environmental changes associated with the ‘Anthropocene’ is generally discussed in behavioral ecology (e.g. here or here), and insights from respective studies will help to improve the survival of endangered species. Therefore, I would like to contribute to this discussion by investigating how environmental changes affect individual behavioral patterns and survival, and, ultimately, population dynamics in different species of primates.\nTogether with collaborators, I have shown that extreme climate events impact food availability, behavior, infant survival and reproductive activity in fruit-eating spider (Ateles spp.) and capuchin (Cebus imitator) monkeys (Campos et al., 2020; Hartwell et al., 2021). My research group and I now investigate these cascading effects of climate change on food availability, behavior and survival in the leaf-eating, endangered red colobus (Piliocolobus tephrosceles) in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We combine long-term data analysis with computational simulations to investigate how climate patterns are linked to the availability of young leaves (their primary diet), and how both climate and food availability impact their behavior, fitness, and population dynamics. As part of this project, we are developing computer simulations that explore the reliability of food preference indices in different foraging contexts. Based on our results, we will use the appropriate tools to investigate the dietary requirements of red colobus and how their essential nutrients are impacted by climate patterns.\n","date":1675036800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675036800,"objectID":"474d78f6eb600b2f27d0d38b3bbd5c45","permalink":"https://urskalbitzer.github.io/project/01_changing-environments/","publishdate":"2023-01-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/01_changing-environments/","section":"project","summary":"According to the IUCN, about 60% of the ~500 primate species are threatened by extinction, and this is mainly the result of human activity.

However, starting a decade ago, this situation changed dramatically and Internet access became increasingly available in primate range countries. The rapid growth of smartphone use in developing nations has created new avenues to communicate conservation. Here we assess the potential of social media to promote primate conservation at the local level within primate range countries. We interviewed 381 people in communities associated with 18 conservation projects from 11 countries to assess their use of social media. We found that 91% of the people had at least one social media account and 95% of these people checked their accounts daily. The median number of contacts per person across all platforms was 453 and 300 considering only each person’s most used platform. We also documented that local conservation projects had a diversity of information they wanted to relay to the local community through social media. Our research highlights the potential for social media to be an extremely useful communication tool for tropical conservation scientists. Thus, we encourage more conservation groups to explore using social media to communicate to local communities and to report on the impact it has on conservation.","tags":["primate conservation","conservation education","conservation outreach","digital communication","environmental awareness","Internet access"],"title":"Social media’s potential to promote conservation at the local level: an assessment in eleven primate range countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roi Harel","Shauhin Alavi","Alison M.

Animal movement through forest canopies is constrained; unlike most aquatic or aerial habitats, the three-dimensional space of a forest canopy is not fully realized or available to the animals within it. Determining how the unique constraints of arboreal habitats shape the ecology and evolution of canopy-dwelling animals is key to fully understanding forest ecosystems. With emerging technologies, there is now the opportunity to quantify and map tree connectivity, and to embed the fine-scale horizontal and vertical position of moving animals into these networks of branching pathways. Integrating detailed multi-dimensional habitat structure and animal movement data will enable us to see the world from the perspective of an arboreal animal. This synthesis will shed light on fundamental aspects of arboreal animals’ cognition and ecology, including how they navigate landscapes of risk and reward and weigh energetic trade-offs, as well as how their environment shapes their spatial cognition and their social dynamics.","tags":null,"title":"Life in 2.5D: Animal Movement in the Trees","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew Hacket-Pain","Jessie J.

The mean and median time-series length is 12.4 and 10 years respectively, and the data set includes 1122 series that extend over at least two decades (≥20 years of observations). For a subset of well-studied species, MASTREE+ includes extensive replication of time-series across geographical and climatic gradients. Here we describe the open-access data set, available as a.csv file, and we introduce an associated web-based app for data exploration.

Africa is projected to quadruple its population by 2100 and experience increasingly severe climate change and environmental conflict—all of which will ravage biodiversity. Here we assess conservation threats facing Africa and consider how these threats will be affected by human population growth, economic expansion, and climate change. We then evaluate the current capacity and infrastructure available to conserve the continent’s biodiversity. We consider four key questions essential for the future of African conservation: (1) how to build societal support for conservation efforts within Africa; (2) how to build Africa’s education, research, and management capacity; (3) how to finance conservation efforts; and (4) is conservation through development the appropriate approach for Africa? While the challenges are great, ways forward are clear, and we present ideas on how progress can be made. Given Africa’s current modest capacity to address its biodiversity crisis, additional international funding is required, but estimates of the cost of conserving Africa’s biodiversity are within reach. The will to act must build on the sympathy for conservation that is evident in Africa, but this will require building the education capacity within the continent. Considering Africa’s rapidly growing population and the associated huge economic needs, options other than conservation through development need to be more effectively explored. Despite the gravity of the situation, we believe that concerted effort in the coming decades can successfully curb the loss of biodiversity in Africa.","tags":null,"title":"The future of sub-Saharan Africa’s biodiversity in the face of climate and societal change","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Colin A.

Although infanticide is likely adaptive for males, it imposes costs on females that are difficult to quantify without long-term demographic data. Here we investigate effects of AMRs and infanticide on female reproductive success and how these costs affect capuchin groups. We investigate (1) effects of AMR frequency on the production of surviving infants; (2) energetic and (3) temporal “opportunity costs” of infant loss; and (4) how AMR frequency impacts capuchin group sizes. Materials and methods We censused six groups (7–33 years/group, 74 adult females). We modeled surviving infant production in relation to AMR. We estimated a female's energy requirements for lost infants and the temporal cost relative to the median reproductive window. We simulated how varying AMR rates would affect future capuchin group sizes. Results Females exposed to more frequent AMR tended to produce fewer surviving offspring. We estimate the average lost infant requires approximately 33% additional energy intake for its mother and represents 10% of the average reproductive opportunity window available to females. Simulated populations remain viable at the observed rate of AMR occurrence but decrease in size at even slightly higher rates. Discussion While infanticide is adaptive for males, for females it affects lifetime reproductive success and imposes energetic and opportunity costs. Although capuchin populations have evolved with AMRs and infanticide, small increases in AMR frequency may lead to population decline/extinction. Infanticide likely plays a large role in population maintenance for capuchins.","tags":["long-term data","alpha male replacement","Cebus capucinus imitator","population viability analysis","survival analysis"],"title":"Costs of male infanticide for female capuchins: When does an adaptive male reproductive strategy become costly for females and detrimental to population viability?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kayla S.

But what type of action? Here we argue that restoration of primate habitat will be an essential component of strategies aimed at conserving primates and preventing the extinctions that may occur before the end of the century and propose that primates can act as flagship species for restoration efforts. To do this we gathered a team of academics from around the world with experience in restoration so that we could provide examples of why primate restoration ecology is needed, outline how primates can act as flagship species for restoration efforts of tropical forest, review what little is known about how primate populations respond to restoration efforts, and make specific recommendations of the next steps needed to make restoration of primate populations successful. We set four priorities: (1) academics must effectively communicate both the value of primates and the need for restoration; (2) more research is needed on how primates contribute to forest restoration; (3) more effort must be put into Masters and PhD level training for tropical country nationals; and finally (4) more emphasis is needed to monitor the responses of regenerating forest and primate populations where restoration efforts are initiated. We are optimistic that populations of many threatened species can recover, and extinctions can be prevented, but only if concerted large-scale efforts are made soon and if these efforts include primate habitat restoration.","tags":null,"title":"Primates Can Be a Rallying Symbol to Promote Tropical Forest Restoration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mackenzie L.

We aimed to investigate how ecological factors, social factors, and reproductive state are associated with energetic condition in a wild neotropical primate using non-invasive measures. We first assessed and compared urinary C-peptide levels (uCP), the presence of urinary ketones (uKet), and behaviorally assessed energy balance (bEB) in female white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus imitator) living in Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. Then, we assessed how these measures were associated with feeding competition, dominance rank, and reproductive state. As predicted, uCP and bEB were positively associated with each other, and bEB was negatively associated with uKet. However, we did not find a relationship between uCP and uKet. Females showed lower uCP and bEB values during periods of intense feeding competition, but this relationship was not dependent on dominance rank. Furthermore, rank was not directly associated with uCP and bEB. Urinary ketones, on the other hand, were only produced in the most adverse conditions: by low-ranking, lactating females during periods of intense feeding competition. Behavioral strategies are assumed to maximize reproductive success and not energetic condition per se, which might explain why rank was not generally associated with energetic condition in our study population. This highlights the importance of considering potential differences between reproductive success and proxies of reproductive success, such as energetic condition or food intake, when investigating predictions of socioecological models.","tags":["Food availability","C-peptide","Dominance","Energy balance","Food competition","Ketone","Socioecological theory","Socioecology"],"title":"Non-invasive estimation of the costs of feeding competition in a neotropical primate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fernando A.

Such continuous study provides a rare opportunity to ask questions that are only answerable through decades-long monitoring of these long-lived monkeys. In turn, the mounting data generated by long-term study, including knowledge of lifetime reproductive success, familial relatedness, comprehensive behavioral and dietary repertoires, and patterns of inter- and intra-annual variation in forest productivity, provide diverse opportunities to researchers, and facilitate studies that are of shorter duration. Here, we review some of the contributions of our longitudinal research on white-faced capuchins and Geoffroy's spider monkeys, together with newer studies on mantled howler monkeys. We begin by synthesizing findings from our research on demography, dispersal, social relationships, and reproduction. These life history and social traits interact with their foraging and sensory ecology, which we review next. We end by highlighting how the longitudinal study of primates in Sector Santa Rosa has made direct and indirect contributions to the conservation of the critically endangered dry forest biome and its inhabitants, as well as to education, community, and forest restoration initiatives. In particular, we focus our review on how long-term research is uniquely positioned to make key contributions spanning different topical areas. Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.","tags":["social relationships","plant–animal interactions","reproductive strategies","life histories","longitudinal research","sensory ecology"],"title":"Primate life history, social dynamics, ecology, and conservation: Contributions from long-term research in Área de Conservación Guanacaste, Costa Rica","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In many mammals, including humans, individuals form groups in which social relationships can be highly differentiated (i.e., some individuals form strong relationships, while others only have weak ones). As a result, some individuals are socially better integrated than others, which appears to be beneficial for these individuals. For example, other researchers have documented that social integration and support in humans have positive effects on health and longevity (e.g., Yang et al., 2016), and increase the reproductive success (Page et al., 2017). Similarly, highly social female dolphins, horses, and baboons (here, here, or here) exhibit greater fitness parameters, such as offspring survival or longevity, than socially less well integrated individuals.\nOne of my interests is in understanding how female sociability in primates confers these benefits. A study on white-faced capuchins that I conducted during my postdoc with Dr. Linda Fedigan at the University of Calgary showed that infants of highly social females exhibited greater survival during stable periods, but these infants were at greater risk of dying or disappearing during periods of alpha male replacements (Kalbitzer et al. 2017). Probably, new alpha males, which often commit infanticide in this species, are more likely to target the infants of highly social, and therefore central, females. This example illustrates that sociability can also have costs and, therefore, can represent a trade-off in some species. – See the feature in the New Scientist.\nOur study suggested a mechanism that imposes costs on sociability (i.e., being spatially central in the group during alpha male replacements), but what are the mechanisms that provide benefits to sociability? I am currently investigating this question with a variety of approaches, including social network analyses, analyzing alloparenting behavior, and comparing c-peptide levels among female capuchins.\nFurthermore, I extended this research to red colobus monkeys in Uganda in collaboration with Dr. Colin Chapman. This species has a very different type of diet (leaves) from capuchins (mostly fruit and insects), and we are using dynamic social network analyses to investigate how social relationships and the benefits of sociability change depending on the distribution, availability, and nutritional quality of food resources, and how this variation affects offspring survival. For this investigation, we are building on more than a decade of demographic data and collecting data on feeding and social behavior within an ecologically well assessed habitat.\n","date":1562112000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562112000,"objectID":"21b487b128fa33f206a34173886d21d7","permalink":"https://urskalbitzer.github.io/project/04_female-sociability/","publishdate":"2019-07-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/04_female-sociability/","section":"project","summary":"In many mammals, including humans, individuals form groups in which social relationships can be highly differentiated (i.e., some individuals form strong relationships, while others only have weak ones).

However, there are exceptions to this pattern and even males of closely related species can greatly differ. Baboons (Papio spp.) represent such a genus with variation in male reproductive strategies despite their recent common ancestry (around 2 mya).\nFor my PhD thesis with Dr. Julia Fischer, I compared the social behavior between males of two baboon species, chacma baboons in Botswana and Guinea baboons in Senegal because males of these two species appear to represent opposite extremes in terms of their reproductive strategies. Male chacma baboons usually compete intensely to achieve a high dominance rank that provides access to receptive females and, consequently, high reproductive success. On the other hand, male Guinea baboons had been described as living in a multi-level society, with long-term bonds between males and females, male-male cooperation and unknown male dominance relationships.\nMy research demonstrated that males of both species also differed in their aggressiveness and tolerance (Kalbitzer et al. 2015). Male chacma baboons were mainly intolerant of each other, often had agonistic interactions and fights that regularly resulted in serious injuries:\n  Male chacma baboon with a wound after a fight with another male.

In contrast, male Guinea baboons exhibited a high tolerance of each other and even showed affiliative behaviors towards each other (see picture at the top if this page).\nThis difference in social behavior also has consequences for the physiological costs of reproductive behavior: glucocorticoid levels of ‘consorting’ male chacma baboons (males that closely follow an estrous female), are elevated compared to baseline conditions, while such an effect was not observed in the highly tolerant Guinea baboons.\nContrary to what previous research would lead one to believe, a comparison of genetic polymorphisms previously linked to variation in aggressiveness in humans and non-human primates (MAOALPR, 5-HTTLPR), carried out across five species of baboons did not indicate a link between these polymorphisms and interspecific variation in behavior (Kalbitzer et al. 2016)\nI summarized this work in the BMC On Biology blog.\n","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561939200,"objectID":"e95d5a7f1fa896fe23a4ba3138c1bc79","permalink":"https://urskalbitzer.github.io/project/05_male-competition/","publishdate":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/05_male-competition/","section":"project","summary":"In mammals, the most common male reproductive strategy is to compete intensely over access to receptive females, and males show little interest in cooperating with each other.

However, area-wide census methods are time consuming, costly, and not always feasible under many field conditions. Therefore, it is important to establish whether monitoring a subset of a population accurately reflects demographic changes occurring in the population at large. Over the past 35 years, we have conducted 15 area-wide censuses in Sector Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. These efforts have revealed important trends in population growth patterns of capuchin monkeys following the protection and subsequent regeneration of native forests. During this same period, we have also intensively studied a subset of the capuchin groups. Comparing these two datasets, we investigate whether the population structures of the closely monitored groups are reliable indicators of area-wide demographic patterns. We compare the overall group size and the individual age/sex class compositions of study groups and nonstudy groups (i.e., those contacted during area-wide censuses only). Our study groups contained more individuals overall with a larger proportion of infants, and there were indications that the proportion of adult and subadult males was lower. These differences can be ascribed either to sampling errors or real differences attributable to human presence and/or better habitat quality for the study groups. No other sex/age classes differed, and major demographic changes were simultaneously evident in both study and nonstudy groups. This study suggests that the Santa Rosa capuchin population is similarly impacted by large-scale ecological patterns observable within our study groups.","tags":["capuchin","demography","long-term monitoring","population change","Santa Rosa"],"title":"Group versus population level demographics: An analysis of comparability using long term data on wild white-faced capuchin monkeys (textitCebus capucinus imitator)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Urs Kalbitzer","Colin A.

Individuals may vary in their degree of sociality, and this variation can be associated with differential fitness. In some species, for example, female sociality has a positive effect on infant survival. However, investigations of such cases are still rare, and no previous study has considered how male infanticide might constrain effects of female sociality on infant survival. Infanticide is part of the male reproductive strategy in many mammals, and it has the potential to override, or even reverse, effects of female reproductive strategies, including sociality. Therefore, we investigated the relationships between female sociality, offspring survival, and infanticide risk in wild white-faced capuchin monkeys using long-term data from Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. Female capuchins formed differentiated bonds, and bond strength was predicted by kin relationship, rank difference, and the presence of female infants. Most females formed stable bonds with their top social partners, although bond stability varied considerably. Offspring of highly social females, who were often high-ranking females, exhibited higher survivorship during stable periods compared with offspring of less social females. However, offspring of highly social females were more likely to die or disappear during periods of alpha male replacements, probably because new alpha males are central to the group, and therefore more likely to target the infants of highly social, central females. This study shows that female sociality in mammals can have negative fitness consequences that are imposed by male behavior.","tags":["capuchin","social bond","Infanticide","mammal","Reproductive success"],"title":"Female sociality and sexual conflict shape offspring survival in a Neotropical primate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julia Fischer","Gisela H.

Although baboons have been prominently featured in this context, historically little was known about the westernmost member of the genus, the Guinea baboon (Papio papio).   Material and Methods  Here, we summarize the findings from the first years of observations at the field site CRP Simenti in the Niokolo Koba National Park in Senegal.   Results  Guinea baboons reveal a nested multi-level social organization, with reproductive units comprising one “primary” male, one to several females, young, and occasionally “secondary” males at the base of the society. Three to five units form “parties,” which team up with other parties to form a “gang.” Different gangs have largely overlapping home ranges and agonistic interactions between different parties or gangs are rare. Some but not all strongly socially bonded males are highly related, and population genetic and behavioral evidence indicate female-biased dispersal. Females play an important role in intersexual bond formation and maintenance, and female tenure length varies between a few weeks to several years.   Discussion  While the social organization resembles that of hamadryas baboons (P. hamadryas), the social structure differs considerably, specifically in terms of low male aggressiveness and female freedom. Despite substantial differences in social organization and social structure, the acoustic structure of Guinea baboon vocalizations does not differ substantially from that of other baboon taxa. With its multi-level organization, stable bonds between males and females, as well as a high-degree of male-male cooperation and tolerance, Guinea baboons constitute an intriguing model for reconstructing human social evolution.","tags":["Human evolution","FEMALE DISPERSAL","Guinea baboons","nested multi-level society","Papio papio","primate evolution","Social system"],"title":"Charting the neglected West: The social system of Guinea baboons","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Urs Kalbitzer","Christian Roos","Gisela H.

To further investigate the genetics underlying interspecific variation in aggressiveness, 123 wild individuals from five baboon species (Papio papio, P. hamadryas, P. anubis, P. cynocephalus, and P. ursinus) were screened for two polymorphisms in promoter regions of genes relevant for the 5-HT system (5-HTTLPR and MAOALPR).","tags":["Primate","Baboon","candidate gene","macaque","5-HT","Behavioral genetics","Macaca","MAOA-uVNTR","Neurotransmitter"],"title":"Insights into the genetic foundation of aggression in textitPapio and the evolution of two length-polymorphisms in the promoter regions of serotonin-related genes (5-HTTLPR and MAOALPR) in Papionini","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Urs Kalbitzer","Michael Heistermann","Dorothy Cheney","Robert Seyfarth","Julia Fischer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441065600,"objectID":"4bec72446e220167412f48705dd8c235","permalink":"https://urskalbitzer.github.io/publication/kalbitzer-social-2015/","publishdate":"2023-01-30T12:48:02.080813Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kalbitzer-social-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Social behavior and patterns of testosterone and glucocorticoid levels differ between male chacma and Guinea baboons","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Annika Patzelt","Gisela H.
