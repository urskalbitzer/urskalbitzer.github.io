We aimed to investigate how ecological factors, social factors, and reproductive state are associated with energetic condition in a wild neotropical primate using non-invasive measures. We first assessed and compared urinary C-peptide levels (uCP), the presence of urinary ketones (uKet), and behaviorally assessed energy balance (bEB) in female white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus imitator) living in Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. Then, we assessed how these measures were associated with feeding competition, dominance rank, and reproductive state. As predicted, uCP and bEB were positively associated with each other, and bEB was negatively associated with uKet. However, we did not find a relationship between uCP and uKet. Females showed lower uCP and bEB values during periods of intense feeding competition, but this relationship was not dependent on dominance rank. Furthermore, rank was not directly associated with uCP and bEB. Urinary ketones, on the other hand, were only produced in the most adverse conditions: by low-ranking, lactating females during periods of intense feeding competition. Behavioral strategies are assumed to maximize reproductive success and not energetic condition per se, which might explain why rank was not generally associated with energetic condition in our study population. This highlights the importance of considering potential differences between reproductive success and proxies of reproductive success, such as energetic condition or food intake, when investigating predictions of socioecological models.","tags":["C-peptide","Dominance","Energy balance","Food availability","Food competition","Ketone","Socioecological theory","Socioecology"],"title":"Non-invasive estimation of the costs of feeding competition in a neotropical primate","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In many mammals, including humans, individuals form groups in which social relationships can be highly differentiated (i.e., some individuals form strong relationships, while others only have weak ones). As a result, some individuals are socially better integrated than others, which appears to be beneficial for these individuals. For example, other researchers have documented that social integration and support in humans have positive effects on health and longevity (e.g., Yang et al., 2016), and increase the reproductive success (Page et al., 2017). Similarly, highly social female dolphins, horses, and baboons (here, here, or here) exhibit greater fitness parameters, such as offspring survival or longevity, than socially less well integrated individuals.\nOne of my interests is in understanding how female sociability in primates confers these benefits. A study on white-faced capuchins that I conducted during my postdoc with Dr. Linda Fedigan at the University of Calgary showed that infants of highly social females exhibited greater survival during stable periods, but these infants were at greater risk of dying or disappearing during periods of alpha male replacements (Kalbitzer et al. 2017). Probably, new alpha males, which often commit infanticide in this species, are more likely to target the infants of highly social, and therefore central, females. This example illustrates that sociability can also have costs and, therefore, can represent a trade-off in some species. \u0026ndash; See the feature in the New Scientist.\nOur study suggested a mechanism that imposes costs on sociability (i.e., being spatially central in the group during alpha male replacements), but what are the mechanisms that provide benefits to sociability? I am currently investigating this question with a variety of approaches, including social network analyses, analyzing alloparenting behavior, and comparing c-peptide levels among female capuchins.\nFurthermore, I extended this research to red colobus monkeys in Uganda in collaboration with Dr. Colin Chapman. This species has a very different type of diet (leaves) from capuchins (mostly fruit and insects), and we are using dynamic social network analyses to investigate how social relationships and the benefits of sociability change depending on the distribution, availability, and nutritional quality of food resources, and how this variation affects offspring survival. For this investigation, we are building on more than a decade of demographic data and collecting data on feeding and social behavior within an ecologically well assessed habitat.\n","date":1562112000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562112000,"objectID":"6c8819ce4d496db4f783e4605aefc421","permalink":"/project/01_female-sociability/","publishdate":"2019-07-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/01_female-sociability/","section":"project","summary":"Female sociability and fitness in primates","tags":null,"title":"Female Sociability","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"According to the IUCN, about 60% of the ~500 primate species are threatened by extinction, and this is mainly the result of human activity\nEnvironmental changes linked to human activities include landscape modifications, hunting and other interactions between human and non-human primates, and climate change.\nPrimates seem to be especially vulnerable to these rapid changes because of their slow life-histories and long generation times.

However, there are exceptions to this pattern and even males of closely related species can greatly differ. Baboons (Papio spp.) represent such a genus with variation in male reproductive strategies despite their recent common ancestry (around 2 mya).\nFor my PhD thesis with Dr. Julia Fischer, I compared the social behavior between males of two baboon species, chacma baboons in Botswana and Guinea baboons in Senegal because males of these two species appear to represent opposite extremes in terms of their reproductive strategies. Male chacma baboons usually compete intensely to achieve a high dominance rank that provides access to receptive females and, consequently, high reproductive success. On the other hand, male Guinea baboons had been described as living in a multi-level society, with long-term bonds between males and females, male-male cooperation and unknown male dominance relationships.\nMy research demonstrated that males of both species also differed in their aggressiveness and tolerance (Kalbitzer et al. 2015). Male chacma baboons were mainly intolerant of each other, often had agonistic interactions and fights that regularly resulted in serious injuries:\n   Male chacma baboon with a wound after a fight with another male. Photo by Urs Kalbitzer.   In contrast, male Guinea baboons exhibited a high tolerance of each other and even showed affiliative behaviors towards each other (see picture at the top if this page).\nThis difference in social behavior also has consequences for the physiological costs of reproductive behavior: glucocorticoid levels of \u0026lsquo;consorting\u0026rsquo; male chacma baboons (males that closely follow an estrous female), are elevated compared to baseline conditions, while such an effect was not observed in the highly tolerant Guinea baboons.\nContrary to what previous research would lead one to believe, a comparison of genetic polymorphisms previously linked to variation in aggressiveness in humans and non-human primates (MAOALPR, 5-HTTLPR), carried out across five species of baboons did not indicate a link between these polymorphisms and interspecific variation in behavior (Kalbitzer et al. 2016)\nI summarized this work in the BMC On Biology blog.\n","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561939200,"objectID":"08dc6cef89a719b43b26912e8c0ce89c","permalink":"/project/03_male-competition/","publishdate":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/03_male-competition/","section":"project","summary":"Male-male competition and tolerance in baboons.","tags":null,"title":"Male-male competition","type":"project"},{"authors":["Anagaw Atickem","Nils Chr Stenseth","Peter J Fashing","Nga Nguyen","Colin A Chapman","Afework Bekele","Addisu Mekonnen","Patrick A Omeja","**Urs Kalbitzer**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559347200,"objectID":"88c7a49a38052ad38856860ff5c53466","permalink":"/publication/atickem-build-2019/","publishdate":"2020-01-25T04:47:43.518123Z","relpermalink":"/publication/atickem-build-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"To cope with climate change and population growth, the continent urgently needs more home-grown researchers, argue Anagaw Atickem, Nils Chr.

However, area-wide census methods are time consuming, costly, and not always feasible under many field conditions. Therefore, it is important to establish whether monitoring a subset of a population accurately reflects demographic changes occurring in the population at large. Over the past 35 years, we have conducted 15 area-wide censuses in Sector Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. These efforts have revealed important trends in population growth patterns of capuchin monkeys following the protection and subsequent regeneration of native forests. During this same period, we have also intensively studied a subset of the capuchin groups. Comparing these two datasets, we investigate whether the population structures of the closely monitored groups are reliable indicators of area-wide demographic patterns. We compare the overall group size and the individual age/sex class compositions of study groups and nonstudy groups (i.e., those contacted during area-wide censuses only). Our study groups contained more individuals overall with a larger proportion of infants, and there were indications that the proportion of adult and subadult males was lower. These differences can be ascribed either to sampling errors or real differences attributable to human presence and/or better habitat quality for the study groups. No other sex/age classes differed, and major demographic changes were simultaneously evident in both study and nonstudy groups. This study suggests that the Santa Rosa capuchin population is similarly impacted by large-scale ecological patterns observable within our study groups.","tags":["capuchin","demography","long-term monitoring","population change","Santa Rosa"],"title":"Group versus population level demographics: An analysis of comparability using long term data on wild white-faced capuchin monkeys (\u003ci\u003eCebus capucinus imitator\u003c/i\u003e)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Urs Kalbitzer**","Colin A Chapman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"35533ebd2f8569059a00a82645f75433","permalink":"/publication/kalbitzer-primate-2018-1/","publishdate":"2020-01-25T04:47:43.510736Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kalbitzer-primate-2018-1/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Primate Responses to Changing Environments in the Anthropocene","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kim Valenta","**Urs Kalbitzer**","Diary Razafimandimby","Patrick A Omeja","Manfred Ayasse","Colin .

Individuals may vary in their degree of sociality, and this variation can be associated with differential fitness. In some species, for example, female sociality has a positive effect on infant survival. However, investigations of such cases are still rare, and no previous study has considered how male infanticide might constrain effects of female sociality on infant survival. Infanticide is part of the male reproductive strategy in many mammals, and it has the potential to override, or even reverse, effects of female reproductive strategies, including sociality. Therefore, we investigated the relationships between female sociality, offspring survival, and infanticide risk in wild white-faced capuchin monkeys using long-term data from Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. Female capuchins formed differentiated bonds, and bond strength was predicted by kin relationship, rank difference, and the presence of female infants. Most females formed stable bonds with their top social partners, although bond stability varied considerably. Offspring of highly social females, who were often high-ranking females, exhibited higher survivorship during stable periods compared with offspring of less social females. However, offspring of highly social females were more likely to die or disappear during periods of alpha male replacements, probably because new alpha males are central to the group, and therefore more likely to target the infants of highly social, central females. This study shows that female sociality in mammals can have negative fitness consequences that are imposed by male behavior.","tags":["Reproductive success","Infanticide","social bond","mammal","capuchin"],"title":"Female sociality and sexual conflict shape offspring survival in a Neotropical primate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julia Fischer","Gisela H Kopp","Federica Dal Pesco","Adeelia Goffe","Kurt Hammerschmidt","**Urs Kalbitzer**","Matthias Klapproth","Peter Maciej","Ibrahima Ndao","Annika Patzelt","Dietmar Zinner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"dac5da54b1a82bbe4b01d6eb4e62d351","permalink":"/publication/fischer-charting-2017/","publishdate":"2020-01-25T04:47:43.514525Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fischer-charting-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Objectives  Primate social systems are remarkably diverse, and thus play a central role in understanding social evolution, including the biological origin of human societies. Although baboons have been prominently featured in this context, historically little was known about the westernmost member of the genus, the Guinea baboon (Papio papio).   Material and Methods  Here, we summarize the findings from the first years of observations at the field site CRP Simenti in the Niokolo Koba National Park in Senegal.   Results  Guinea baboons reveal a nested multi-level social organization, with reproductive units comprising one “primary” male, one to several females, young, and occasionally “secondary” males at the base of the society. Three to five units form “parties,” which team up with other parties to form a “gang.” Different gangs have largely overlapping home ranges and agonistic interactions between different parties or gangs are rare. Some but not all strongly socially bonded males are highly related, and population genetic and behavioral evidence indicate female-biased dispersal. Females play an important role in intersexual bond formation and maintenance, and female tenure length varies between a few weeks to several years.   Discussion  While the social organization resembles that of hamadryas baboons (P. hamadryas), the social structure differs considerably, specifically in terms of low male aggressiveness and female freedom. Despite substantial differences in social organization and social structure, the acoustic structure of Guinea baboon vocalizations does not differ substantially from that of other baboon taxa. With its multi-level organization, stable bonds between males and females, as well as a high-degree of male-male cooperation and tolerance, Guinea baboons constitute an intriguing model for reconstructing human social evolution.","tags":["Papio papio","Female dispersal","Social system","Human evolution","Guinea baboons","Nested multi-level society","Primate evolution"],"title":"Charting the neglected West: The social system of Guinea baboons","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Urs Kalbitzer**","Christian Roos","Gisela H Kopp","Thomas M Butynski","Sascha Knauf","Dietmar Zinner","Julia Fischer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"13f5a11f7447c1a00869aece2834b49b","permalink":"/publication/kalbitzer-insights-2016/","publishdate":"2020-01-25T04:47:43.513411Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kalbitzer-insights-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Aggressive behaviors are an integral part of competitive interactions.

To further investigate the genetics underlying interspecific variation in aggressiveness, 123 wild individuals from five baboon species (Papio papio, P. hamadryas, P. anubis, P. cynocephalus, and P. ursinus) were screened for two polymorphisms in promoter regions of genes relevant for the 5-HT system (5-HTTLPR and MAOALPR).","tags":["macaque","Primate","Baboon","5-HT","Behavioral genetics","candidate gene","Macaca","MAOA-uVNTR","Neurotransmitter"],"title":"Insights into the genetic foundation of aggression in textitPapio and the evolution of two length-polymorphisms in the promoter regions of serotonin-related genes (5-HTTLPR and MAOALPR) in Papionini","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Urs Kalbitzer**","Michael Heistermann","Dorothy Cheney","Robert Seyfarth","Julia Fischer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441065600,"objectID":"4bec72446e220167412f48705dd8c235","permalink":"/publication/kalbitzer-social-2015/","publishdate":"2020-01-25T04:47:43.511452Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kalbitzer-social-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Social behavior and patterns of testosterone and glucocorticoid levels differ between male chacma and Guinea baboons","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Annika Patzelt","Gisela H Kopp","Ibrahima Ndao","**Urs Kalbitzer**","Dietmar Zinner","Julia Fischer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1412121600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1412121600,"objectID":"840446fe40725609a9ec033505aebba8","permalink":"/publication/patzelt-male-2014/","publishdate":"2020-01-25T04:47:43.497427Z","relpermalink":"/publication/patzelt-male-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["association index","fission–fusion","multilevel society","range expansion","social network analysis"],"title":"Male tolerance and male–male bonds in a multilevel primate society","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Kalbitzer","**Urs Kalbitzer**","Gitte Moos Knudsen","Paul Cumming","Andreas Heinz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1380585600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1380585600,"objectID":"4ffbf55a8aee057618c13e56da21daad","permalink":"/publication/kalbitzer-how-2013/","publishdate":"2020-01-25T04:47:43.512074Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kalbitzer-how-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"How the cerebral serotonin homeostasis predicts environmental changes: a model to explain seasonal changes of brain 5-HTT as intermediate phenotype of the 5-HTTLPR","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brandon C Wheeler","Barbara Tiddi","**Urs Kalbitzer**","Elisabetta Visalberghi","Michael Heistermann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1375315200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1375315200,"objectID":"a7715ecb3bec14d644343514ce428d7c","permalink":"/publication/wheeler-methodological-2013/","publishdate":"2020-01-25T04:47:43.512809Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wheeler-methodological-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Methodological considerations in the analysis of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites in tufted capuchins (textitCebus apella)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Urs Kalbitzer**","Michael Heistermann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1367366400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1367366400,"objectID":"3e9b3bfc493b0e588c05c9b17af98f91","permalink":"/publication/kalbitzer-long-term-2013/","publishdate":"2020-01-25T04:47:43.513947Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kalbitzer-long-term-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Long-term storage effects in steroid metabolite extracts from baboon (textitPapio sp.) faeces - a comparison of three commonly applied storage methods","type":"publication"}]
